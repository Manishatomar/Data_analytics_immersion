The dataset "Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2023" from the CDC includes detailed records of COVID-19 deaths and contributing conditions, segmented by age group and state. In the analysis, I cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, filtering out non-informative rows, and converting data types for accuracy and efficiency. The analysis explored demographic and geographic patterns in COVID-19 death rates and contributing conditions, examined temporal trends, and identified key variables affecting mortality rates. These insights inform public health strategies and enable predictive modeling to target high-risk populations effectively.
